## üöÄ Featured Projects

### [Preventative Pulse ‚Äì Health Risk Prediction Dashboard](projects/preventative-pulse.html)
Developed an **interactive predictive analytics dashboard** for early detection and prevention of chronic disease.  
Integrated **CDC BRFSS data**, **logistic regression**, and **ensemble learning** to identify high-risk individuals and model intervention outcomes.  
Focused on **public health intelligence**, data ethics, and actionable insights for policy and wellness programs.

### [OCR with Deep Learning (CRNN Model)](projects/ocr-deep-learning.html)
Built a **Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN)** trained on the **MJSynth (Synth90k)** dataset.  
Benchmarked against **Tesseract** and **Google Vision AI**, achieving high accuracy on text-in-image recognition.

### [Sentiment Analysis using NLP](projects/sentiment-analysis.html)
Developed an **NLP pipeline** using **feature engineering**, **NLTK**, and **logistic regression** classifiers to predict sentiment polarity and visualize token-level insights.


### [Process Improvement ‚Äì Calorie Burn Optimization](projects/process-improvement.html)
Implemented a **DMAIC (Lean Six Sigma)** framework to reduce weekly calorie variance and improve exercise consistency.  
Created dashboards and visual summaries tracking workouts, calories, and time-of-day performance.
