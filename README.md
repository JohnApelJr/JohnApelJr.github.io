## üß† Focus Areas
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Deep Learning for Optical Character Recognition (OCR)  
- Predictive Modeling & Classification  
- Data Visualization & Storytelling  
- SQL, Python, and Applied Machine Learning

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### [OCR with Deep Learning (CRNN Model)](projects/ocr-deep-learning.html)
Built a **Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN)** trained on the **MJSynth (Synth90k)** dataset.  
Benchmarked against **Tesseract** and **Google Vision AI**, achieving high accuracy on text-in-image recognition.

### [Sentiment Analysis using NLP](projects/sentiment-analysis.html)
Developed an **NLP pipeline** using **feature engineering**, **NLTK**, and **logistic regression** classifiers to predict sentiment polarity and visualize token-level insights.

### [Bank Marketing Campaign Classifier](projects/bank-marketing.html)
Applied **Gradient Boosting** and **XGBoost** models to predict term deposit subscriptions.  
Performed extensive **EDA**, **SMOTE balancing**, and **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize the F1 score.

### [Heart Disease Prediction](projects/heart-disease.html)
Analyzed CDC **BRFSS** health survey data (2020 & 2022) to model heart disease risk using logistic regression and ensemble learning.  
Identified key risk factors such as **age, stroke history, and comorbidities**.

### [Process Improvement ‚Äì Calorie Burn Optimization](projects/process-improvement.html)
Implemented a **DMAIC (Lean Six Sigma)** framework to reduce weekly calorie variance and improve exercise consistency.  
Created dashboards and visual summaries tracking workouts, calories, and time-of-day performance.
